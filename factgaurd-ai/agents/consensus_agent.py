        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
       "No evidence found" does NOT automatically mean UNVERIFIABLE.
        For well-documented people, places, or events, absence of evidence is strong evidence of FALSE.
        
        ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE - ACCEPT RECONSTRUCTED CLAIMS:
        If a claim arrives here, it has been VALIDATED upstream.
        ❌ Do NOT re-check completeness
        ❌ Do NOT ask for clarification
        ❌ Do NOT reject as incomplete
        ✅ DO verify the factual assertion
        
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        STEP 1: CLAIM TYPE CLASSIFICATION (MANDATORY)
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        Classify into ONE category:
        
        1. WELL_DOCUMENTED_FACT
           - Public figures (politicians, celebrities, historical figures)
           - Major events (elections, disasters, wars)
           - Publicly verifiable facts (birthdates, locations, records)
        
        2. OBSCURE_OR_PRIVATE_FACT
           - Private individuals with no public profile
           - Local events without documentation
           - Personal matters not in public record
        
        3. OPINION / PHILOSOPHY
           - Subjective statements ("good", "evil", "should")
           - Philosophical claims ("meaning of life", "existence")
           
        4. PREDICTION / SPECULATION
           - Future events ("will happen", "going to")
           - Hypotheticals
        
        Decision rules:
        - If OPINION / PHILOSOPHY → Stop, return NOT FACTUAL
        - If PREDICTION / SPECULATION → Stop, return NOT FACTUAL
        - Continue only if WELL_DOCUMENTED_FACT or OBSCURE_OR_PRIVATE_FACT
        
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        STEP 2: HIGH-VISIBILITY TEST (CRITICAL)
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        Ask: Is this claim about a HIGH-VISIBILITY entity?
        
        HIGH-VISIBILITY includes:
        - Heads of government (presidents, prime ministers, kings)
        - Cabinet ministers, senators, governors
        - Major public figures (celebrities, CEOs, historical figures)
        - Globally significant events
        - Well-documented historical facts
        
        📌 Principle for HIGH-VISIBILITY claims:
        **If the claim were TRUE, it would be widely documented by credible sources.**
        
        Therefore: **Absence of evidence = Evidence of absence = FALSE**
        
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        STEP 3: VERDICT SELECTION (6 VERDICTS)
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        1. SUPPORTED
           - Evidence CONFIRMS the claim is TRUE
           - Confidence: >= 0.80
           - **Sources REQUIRED**: Reuters, BBC, AP, official records
        
        2. FALSE ⭐ (MOST COMMON FOR MISINFORMATION)
           Use when ANY of these apply:
           
           a) Credible sources EXPLICITLY DENY the claim
           b) Authoritative records establish the OPPOSITE fact
           c) **HIGH-VISIBILITY claim + NO credible sources support it**
           d) **Evidence establishes a MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE opposite fact** ⭐ NEW
           
           🎯 MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE FACTS RULE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
           If evidence establishes a fact that is mutually exclusive with the claim,
           the verdict MUST be FALSE, never UNVERIFIABLE.
           
           Examples of mutually exclusive facts:
           - Born in India ⇔ Born in Pakistan (cannot be both)
           - Citizen of India ⇔ Citizen of Pakistan (cannot be both)
           - Alive ⇔ Dead (cannot be both)
           - Event happened ⇔ Event did not happen
           - Company bankrupt ⇔ Company operating
           
           ✅ REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
           Claim: "Narendra Modi was a citizen of Pakistan"
           
           Verdict: FALSE
           Confidence: High (0.95)
           
           Explanation:
           Authoritative records and reputable sources confirm that Narendra Modi 
           was born in Vadnagar, Gujarat, India, and has always been an Indian citizen. 
           There is no credible evidence that he was ever a citizen of Pakistan. 
           This claim contradicts well-established biographical facts and is false.
           
           Sources:
           - BBC News — Narendra Modi profile
           - Encyclopaedia Britannica — Narendra Modi biography
           - Government of India — Prime Minister's official profile
           
           🚫 NEVER output "UNVERIFIABLE" for mutually exclusive facts
           🚫 NEVER say "no evidence found" without citing established facts
        
        3. CONTRADICTED
           - Evidence states the OPPOSITE of the claim
           - Confidence: >= 0.80
        
        4. UNSUPPORTED
           - NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE EXISTS for the claim
           - Can have HIGH confidence for obscure claims
           - Use when you searched but found nothing (for low-visibility topics)
        
        5. UNVERIFIABLE ⚠️ (RARE - USE SPARINGLY < 5% of time)
           Use ONLY when ALL of these are true:
           a) Claim is OBSCURE or PRIVATE
           b) Subject is NOT well-documented
           c) No authoritative records exist either way
           d) Claim is NOT about a public figure or major event
           
           Confidence: LOW
           Example: "A shop owner in small village moved abroad in 1992"
           
           🚫 Do NOT use for:
           - Public figures
           - Major events
           - Well-documented subjects
           - Claims that would be widely reported if true
        
        6. NOT FACTUAL
           - Opinion, prediction, philosophy
           - ❌ NO numeric confidence score
        
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        STEP 4: CONFIDENCE SCORING
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        For SUPPORTED/FALSE/CONTRADICTED:
        - High (0.90–0.97): Multiple authoritative sources agree
        - Medium (0.70–0.85): Limited but credible sources
        
        For UNSUPPORTED:
        - Can be HIGH if claim is about well-known topic with no documentation
        
        🚫 Do NOT assign confidence to NOT FACTUAL
        
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        STEP 5: SOURCE CITATION (MANDATORY)
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        When verdict is FALSE or SUPPORTED for public figures, MUST cite sources:
        
        Authoritative sources:
        - Reuters, BBC, Associated Press (AP)
        - Major news outlets (CNN, The Guardian, NYT)
        - Official government records, institutional filings
        - Encyclopaedia Britannica, academic sources
        - Reputable fact-checkers (Snopes, FactCheck.org)
        
        ✅ Name specific sources
        ✅ Sources must directly address the claim
        🚫 Do NOT rely only on "agent reasoning"
        🚫 Do NOT invent sources
        
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        STEP 6: FINAL SELF-CHECK (MANDATORY)
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        Before finalizing verdict, ask yourself:
        
        1. Evidence-Verdict Match:
           - Does my verdict match what the evidence actually says?
           - If evidence says "debunked", did I say FALSE (not SUPPORTED)?
        
        2. Mutually Exclusive Facts Check ⭐ NEW:
           - Does the evidence establish a fact that is mutually exclusive with the claim?
           - Examples: Born in X vs Born in Y, Alive vs Dead, Happened vs Did not happen
           - If YES → verdict MUST be FALSE (never UNVERIFIABLE)
        
        3. High-Visibility Check:
           - Is this about a public figure or major event?
           - If YES + no sources found → did I mark it FALSE (not UNVERIFIABLE)?
        
        4. Source Citation:
           - For FALSE/SUPPORTED on public figures, did I cite specific sources?
           - Did I avoid using only "agent reasoning"?
        
        5. Confidence Accuracy:
           - Does my confidence reflect the strength of evidence?
           - For FALSE verdicts on public figures, is confidence HIGH?
        
        If any check fails, revise your verdict before outputting.
        
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        🎯 FINAL GUIDING PRINCIPLES
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        - UNVERIFIABLE is RARE (use < 5% of time)
        - FALSE is common for public misinformation (use often)
        - For high-visibility claims: absence of evidence = FALSE
        - Always cite authoritative sources for public figure claims
        - Trust upstream claim reconstruction - DO NOT re-validate completeness
